Inputs are microphone (with a built-in pre-amp), line-in and analog CD audio. Line-in can be set (using jumpers) to either the external 3.5mm jack (for external MIDI synthesizers, for example), or internal - from a wavetable plugin card or a software-based MT-32 or MIDI synth on a Raspberry Pi.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-kind-of-internal-synthesizers-can-i-use","title":"Q: What kind of internal synthesizers can I use?","text":"<p>A: There are three internal synth connectors on the board. The first is the 26-pin wavetable connector. Here you can plug in MIDI wavetable cards such as the X2, X2GS, X16, X16GS, etc. from Serdashop - these are modern cards using the Dream chipset and uses soundfonts to replicate various MIDI synthesizers. You've also got two 40-pin connectors for plugging in a Raspberry Pi. Either use the male header with a 40-pin female-female ribbon cable to connect a standard Pi 3 or 4, or you can plug a Pi Zero 2's pins directly into the female connector. Since the Raspberry Pis are full computers in their own sense, they can run all kinds of software synthesizers and output digital I2S audio to the motherboard. There's a PCM5102 DAC on the board to convert the audio to analog, and then feed it into the Crystal sound chip. The easiest way to get a Pi up and running as a synth is to use the mt32-pi software which requires minimal effort. It'll do MT-32 using the munt emulator, and General MIDI using the Fluidsynth application with soundfonts. If you're adventurous and have a Pi 4, you can also run the SC-55 emulator nuked-sc55 on a regular Debian installation, for an extremely accurate Roland SC-55 sound. (See MIDI for more information.)</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-about-the-game-port-connector","title":"Q: What about the game port connector?","text":"<p>A: The game port connector offers limited joystick/gamepad support through the Crystal sound card. In addition, you have MIDI input and output, so you can connect an external synth (like the Roland MT-32 or SC-55) using a standard gameport-to-MIDI breakout cable. See GamePort Limitation for more information.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-whats-the-agp-compatibility-of-the-itx-llama","title":"Q: What's the AGP compatibility of the ITX-Llama?","text":"<p>A: The mechanical/electrical connector on the board is 3.3V-keyed. That means AGP cards with the 3.3V-notch (towards the VGA connector-side of the card) as well as \"universal\" cards with two notches will fit and run. 1.5V-keyed cards with only the notch towards the opposite side of the VGA connector will neither fit nor be compatible with the motherboard's 3.3V-signal level.  From a protocol perspective, this is AGP 1x, with some caveats.</p> <ul> <li> <p>A quite technical summary; there is no native AGP support on the Vortex86EX, only PCI Express x1 (gen 1). This is converted to PCI at 66 MHz by an onboard PI7C9X118 chip. Since AGP is really only PCI running at a higher clock frequency (66 vs 33 MHz), this is fine. However, AGP supports additional features not found on PCI, like split transactions, sideband addressing and GART. What this means is that AGP cards where the Windows driver requires one or more of these AGP-only features will not work properly. In practice, most older cards should work just fine and are probably a better fit for the CPU's speed as well.

That said, it\u2019s certainly helpful to note the grounding considerations with the Mean Well unit. While grounding can add a layer of safety, it's worth mentioning that many modern consumer electronics\u2014including the latest consoles from Microsoft and Sony\u2014use ungrounded C8 connectors without issue.
