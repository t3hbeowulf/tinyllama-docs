AGP has very strict timing tolerances that likely means most adapters might not work reliably. Plan to use low-profile AGP cards if small cases are desired. Several members in Discord have had success using short (under 1.5 inches) risers, both the flexible shielded cable and PCB design.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-does-the-itx-llama-support-adding-a-picogus-or-other-isa-peripherals","title":"Q: Does the ITX-Llama support adding a PicoGUS (or other ISA peripherals)?","text":"<p>A: Unfortunately no. The Vortex86EX has a stripped-down ISA interface with only a single DMA channel. This is being used by the Crystal sound chip. Additionally, the PicoGUS is strictly a DOS sound card and has no Windows 98 support at this time.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-can-i-connect-an-optical-drive","title":"Q: Can I connect an Optical drive?","text":"<p>A: Yes. You can either use a SATA Optical drive connected to the onboard SATA port or an IDE to SATA adapter paired with an IDE Optical drive. IDE Optical drives typically have audio output which can be connected to the onboard Crystal sound card. (See Accessories for more information.)</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-kind-of-psu-should-i-use","title":"Q: What kind of PSU should I use?","text":"<p>A: Any kind will work! The board and CPU uses very little power, only a few watts. The AGP card can draw a little more, but the overall system power consumption will still be comfortably lower than what every modern PSU can deliver. PicoPSUs of at least 80W can be used for saving space inside your case.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-should-the-vortex86ex-som-be-actively-cooled","title":"Q: Should the Vortex86EX SOM be actively cooled?","text":"<p>A: It probably won't have to be, if you have some air flow through the case. If you want to overclock the CPU or have limited air flow, a fan can be mounted above the SOM using the 4 holes around the SOM pin headers on the motherboard. There are also 3 independently controllable (through the BIOS settings menu) fan pin headers on the board. These follow the standard 4-pin PWM fan specification, and can be set to provide 5V or 12V by jumper.

This is configured in the BIOS setting menu.  Additionally, there are two USB HID-only ports you can use to connect modern USB keyboards and mice. The HID protocol is translated into PS/2 using an RP2040 chip on the motherboard, and the connected devices appear as regular PS/2 input devices to the operating system.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-kind-of-serial-communication-does-the-board-offer","title":"Q: What kind of serial communication does the board offer?","text":"<p>A: There are two high-speed UARTs on the board.

It has all the 8 signal lines available. The other UART (COM2) only has data lines (RX/TX), uses TTL logic-level (5V) and is connected to the ESP8266 module and an internal pin header. This can be run at anywhere up to 3 Mbps.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-whats-the-deal-with-the-esp8266-module","title":"Q: What's the deal with the ESP8266 module?","text":"<p>A: This module offers an emulated Hayes-compatible modem (on COM2), and talks to your WiFi network.

It has a very good built-in Adlib/OPL3 FM synth as well, a powerful mixer for various input sources, and can output both analog line-level audio and digital audio (S/PDIF) using a TOSLink optical transmitter connector.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-whats-the-point-of-the-internal-opl3-header-receptacle","title":"Q: What's the point of the internal OPL3 header receptacle?","text":"<p>A: While the CS4237B's emulated OPL3 synth is quite respectable, it's not a perfect 1:1 implementation of the Yamaha YMF262 (OPL3). This is where the OPL3 module comes into play. By plugging in such a module, you get the actual authentic OPL3 hardware using real Yamaha chips. Sound-wise, it's a subtle difference, but it's there.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-are-my-options-for-audio-inputoutput","title":"Q: What are my options for audio input/output?","text":"<p>A: For output you have analog (line-level) and digital (S/PDIF) audio. Inputs are microphone (with a built-in pre-amp), line-in and analog CD audio. Line-in can be set (using jumpers) to either the external 3.5mm jack (for external MIDI synthesizers, for example), or internal - from a wavetable plugin card or a software-based MT-32 or MIDI synth on a Raspberry Pi.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-kind-of-internal-synthesizers-can-i-use","title":"Q: What kind of internal synthesizers can I use?","text":"<p>A: There are three internal synth connectors on the board. The first is the 26-pin wavetable connector. Here you can plug in MIDI wavetable cards such as the X2, X2GS, X16, X16GS, etc. from Serdashop - these are modern cards using the Dream chipset and uses soundfonts to replicate various MIDI synthesizers. You've also got two 40-pin connectors for plugging in a Raspberry Pi. Either use the male header with a 40-pin female-female ribbon cable to connect a standard Pi 3 or 4, or you can plug a Pi Zero 2's pins directly into the female connector. Since the Raspberry Pis are full computers in their own sense, they can run all kinds of software synthesizers and output digital I2S audio to the motherboard. There's a PCM5102 DAC on the board to convert the audio to analog, and then feed it into the Crystal sound chip. The easiest way to get a Pi up and running as a synth is to use the mt32-pi software which requires minimal effort. It'll do MT-32 using the munt emulator, and General MIDI using the Fluidsynth application with soundfonts. If you're adventurous and have a Pi 4, you can also run the SC-55 emulator nuked-sc55 on a regular Debian installation, for an extremely accurate Roland SC-55 sound. (See MIDI for more information.)</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-what-about-the-game-port-connector","title":"Q: What about the game port connector?","text":"<p>A: The game port connector offers limited joystick/gamepad support through the Crystal sound card. In addition, you have MIDI input and output, so you can connect an external synth (like the Roland MT-32 or SC-55) using a standard gameport-to-MIDI breakout cable. See GamePort Limitation for more information.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-whats-the-agp-compatibility-of-the-itx-llama","title":"Q: What's the AGP compatibility of the ITX-Llama?","text":"<p>A: The mechanical/electrical connector on the board is 3.3V-keyed. That means AGP cards with the 3.3V-notch (towards the VGA connector-side of the card) as well as \"universal\" cards with two notches will fit and run. 1.5V-keyed cards with only the notch towards the opposite side of the VGA connector will neither fit nor be compatible with the motherboard's 3.3V-signal level.  From a protocol perspective, this is AGP 1x, with some caveats.</p> <ul> <li> <p>A quite technical summary; there is no native AGP support on the Vortex86EX, only PCI Express x1 (gen 1). This is converted to PCI at 66 MHz by an onboard PI7C9X118 chip. Since AGP is really only PCI running at a higher clock frequency (66 vs 33 MHz), this is fine. However, AGP supports additional features not found on PCI, like split transactions, sideband addressing and GART. What this means is that AGP cards where the Windows driver requires one or more of these AGP-only features will not work properly. In practice, most older cards should work just fine and are probably a better fit for the CPU's speed as well. Of note is the Radeon 9200 / 9250, as well as the Voodoo3 - these have been tested extensively and found to be a very good match.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-does-the-board-have-front-panel-connectors","title":"Q: Does the board have front panel connectors?","text":"<p>A: Yes, power button, reset button, power LED and SD card activity LED.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-does-the-board-have-a-pc-speaker","title":"Q: Does the board have a PC speaker?","text":"<p>A: Yes, an internal one (with two volume settings, configured by jumper), and a pin header for connecting an external speaker.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-which-operating-systems-are-supported","title":"Q: Which operating systems are supported?","text":"<p>A: MS-DOS, FreeDOS and early Windows (3.1, 95, 98).</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-which-storage-devices-can-be-booted-from-and-run-an-operating-system","title":"Q: Which storage devices can be booted from and run an operating system?","text":"<p>A: All of them; microSD, USB and SATA.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/faq/#q-my-question-isnt-listed-here-where-can-i-learn-more","title":"Q: My question isn't listed here, where can I learn more?","text":"<p>A: Try asking in the ITX-Llama thread on the Vogons forum, or join the Discord server.</p>"},{"location":"itxllama/getting-started/","title":"Getting Started with your ITX-Llama","text":"<p>Congratulations!
